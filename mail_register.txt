Hi %USERNAME!

%INVITER has invited _YOU_ to the prestigious RtSys Stammtisch! We will meet once a month in a different venue, i.e., a restaurant or bar, of Kiel.

Please log on with your display name or email address and your password '%PWD' under the following address:
%BASEURL

You can quick-login using the following link:
%BASEURL?cmd=login&user=%EMAIL&pwd=%PWD
Please be aware that your plain text password will be part of the URL in this case!

Please keep your password in a safe place. The password is not stored on site (only its hash). In case you lose your password, you need to find a person of the RtSys group who resets your password.

What can you do there?
1. You should confirm you are going to the next Stammtisch!
2. You can see who else is going and where the Stammtisch takes place.
3. You can vote for the next venue.
4. You can suggest a venue of your like.
5. You can see all past venues.
6. You can choose a different login/display name (the default is an abbreviation of your email address).
7. You can change your password.

Hope to see you soon! The RtSys Stammtisch is a great way to stay connected to what is going on in both, university and industry but also to keep together our fantastic RtSys group members! :)
